## Background
During my PhD, I found that it was crucial to have a system for getting things done. I experimented with a variety of different tools and eventually settled on the combination of a brown noise generator, earplugs/headphones, and a pomodoro timer for really knuckling down on work. Existing pomodoro timers for Windows were either too clunky, too complicated, and/or visually unappealing, so I decided to write my own.

## Features
- Minimalist design
- Cross platform (tested on Windows and OSX)
- Both mouse and keyboard interaction, for convenience
- Three sound options:
  - Brown noise
  - Cafe ambiance
  - Ticker
- Three window options
  - Normal window
  - Floating mode (always on top)
  - Full screen (for preventing distractions during non-computer work, or when you have a spare monitor)

## Requirements
- Pyglet 1.2.4
- Future 0.16.0
